<h1 align="middle">Interactive Erosion Simulator</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Creating an application to model erosion of different materials over time via various erosive agents.</h2>
<h3 align="middle">Newman Hu, Dylan Mcleod, Hanlin Chen</h3>


<h3> Problem Description</h3>
<p>
    We are interested in simulating erosion for the procedural generation of natural looking terrain. This application will be able to simulate natural erosion processes that are unobservable in real time scales. We plan on addressing the effects of water and wind on loosely packed material like soil and sand.
</p>
<br><br>

<h3> Goals and Deliverable </h3>
<p>
    We plan to implement at least one erosive agent and one eroding material most likely wind and sand. With this application we plan to have basic interaction where the user is able to direct the erosive agent to affect the sand. We plan on implementing this with a platform independent online demo.
</p>

<p>
    We hope to create an application that allows you to adjust time scales, as well as choose both the material being eroded and the erosive agent. We would like for it to be fully interactive, with the user having full control of all these parameters when simulating. Ideally, the user will be able to design their starting scene, pick parameters, and run the simulation for a certain amount of time. A successful implementation will ideally run online and allow users to interact with the application independent of their platform. A feature we hope to also implement is real-time rendering on the GPU.
